That lamb, almost made me died from shock
It's covered in parantheses in desolate **
It's like he gotted popped in that arrow that he got
Like it sneezed looking up but won't clean up the snot, No!
Script Hobo, you ain't no Stand Solo
Imma cut a promo on this cocky Quasimodo
Here they call him scripiest, his compilation isn't the prettiest
He ought to change his hame by start going script javeous
That's no web, just part of a network station
Routers in the air, rapping Python nation
A beast with the numpy, and SciPy with a metaphors
I ain't JIT you're looking for
For real, you could really use some help
I heard he designed the interpreter by C++
Cuz he can't script itself, he is sand-boxed on the edge
Even your NetScape-one threw you off the a ledge
Whoah......
What a pathetic ground, Brenden would't be proud
After that there's no reason for me influence the web
Script, I feel bad, you're so tired and sad
The ECMA doesn't have low-level plans?
Your arrows are shaking, your strct keep complexing
You're taking V8cation cuz your timeups are aching
Live to see 28? Don't know how you'll do it
He's got to use the duck-typing to make weak-type moment.
I'm a role model for this ugly, old oddity
I am scripting what I'm scripting, And I'm scripting it properly
I'm everything you are not, I'm everything that you outta be
You are not a web lord, you are really a python-wannabe
Scripty got dependencies, got the braces, arrowchitus
Rebeltitis, caught a sand-box, memory leak, gingifantis
deformitas, file blindness and his sand-box is super bald
But when it's come to scripting, Coffee aint sick at all
